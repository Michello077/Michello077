# Education and experience
Master's degree in **Genetics and Experimental Biology** :microscope: at the University of WrocÅ‚aw, Bachelor's degree in **Bioinformatics** :computer: at the WrocÅ‚aw University of Environmental and Life Sciences, currently postgraduate studies in **Data Science** :chart_with_upwards_trend: at the University of Lower Silesia and during the **Data Scientist in Python** :snake: course in Dataquest - so far and maybe more in the future. I was a prefect for 2 years of study and I took an active part in numerous student science clubs as a chairman or participant.

# Skills and used tools
I am interested in the widely understood **data analysis** and **visualization**, using technologies in programming languages such as **Python** (including Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, or Seaborn packages) and **R**. Currently, I want to develop **databases**, learning **SQL**, **Julia**, and **machine learning**.
I think it's nice to combine technology with a more "natural" area - the natural sciences (including biology) are still largely undiscovered. I know **English** well (level B2.2 and B2+) ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, and I can say something in **German** (level A2/B1) ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª.
I think we have to explore the world, that is why I'm always trying to be open to new experiences!
