# Experience
I have one year of experience as a **Data Analyst** and **Data Scientist**. I work with **bio-data** :fish: and manage it in a database on **Snowflake platform**.\
I use **Python**, **R** and **SQL** languages on a daily basis. I prepare **statistical analyses** and **visualize results** for the R&D department. I calculate and estimate selected biological parameters.\
I also implement **machine learning solutions** and **prepare applications** using the **Streamlit library** for internal use.

# Education
Master's degree in **Genetics and Experimental Biology** :microscope: at the University of WrocÅ‚aw, Bachelor's degree in **Bioinformatics** :computer: at the WrocÅ‚aw University of Environmental and Life Sciences and postgraduate studies in **Data Science** :chart_with_upwards_trend: at the University of Lower Silesia.\
I was a prefect for 2 years of study and I took an active part in numerous student scientific associations as a chairman or participant.

# Skills and used tools
I am interested in the widely understood **data analysis** and **visualization**, using technologies in programming languages such as **Python** (including Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, or Seaborn packages) and **R**. Currently, I want to develop **databases**, learning **SQL**, **Julia**, and **machine learning**.\
I think it's nice to combine technology with a more "natural" area - the natural sciences (including biology) are still largely undiscovered. I know **English** well (level B2.2 and B2+) ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, and I can say something in **German** (level A2/B1) ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª.\
I think we have to explore the world, that is why I'm always trying to be open to new experiences!
